Fundamentals of Statistics

#Binomial Distribution




#Expected Value/Mean/Average


			(for discrete random variables)
			

			(f(x) is the continuous probability distribution of x)

#Geometric average:

The geometric average is always lower than the arithmetic return unless all the numbers are the same. It's a less optimistic version.

#Average:



#Variance


#Sample Variance


#Covariance

A positive covariance means that the two move together.
A negative covariance means that they tend to move opposite each other.

#Correlation 
	


	

The intercept is called alpha, and the slope is called beta. The Shller Inc. return minus the interest rate on the direct-axis and the market return minus the interest rate on lateral axis. In that case, alpha is a measure of how much Shiller Inc out performs. And the beta of the stock is a measure of how much it moves with the market

#Normal distribution / Gaussian distribution




We often assume in finance that random variables, such as returns, are normally distributed.
Normal distribution is the most famous bell-shaped curve.
But there are other ones with different mathematics. A particular interest in finance is fat-tailed 
alternatives.



This distribution has more out in the tails, so we called it fat-tailed.
This refers to random variables that have fat-tailed distributions are random variables that occasionally give you really big outcomes. It's a very important observation in finance that returns on a lot of speculative assets have fat-tailed distributions.
